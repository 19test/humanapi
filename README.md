# humanapi
The easiest way to integrate health data from anywhere.

## Introduction
This package is a simple PHP library for interacting with the HumanAPI endpoints. It provides simple methods for grabbing health information from a number of data sources collected by the HumanAPI. From their own mouths:

> Human API is a platform for human health data that allow developers to easily create applications that retrieve data from a variety of data sources and enable users to share that data with applications of their choice. This data can be anything from activity data recorded by a pedometer, a blood pressure measurement captured by an individual or a medical record from a hospital.
>
> Human API takes care of the data synchronizations with any third party data source, handles user management to manage all user identities accross all integrated devices and services, and processes and normalizes all of their data for your application over a secure, HIPAA compliant, REST based API.

## Installation
Installation is a cinch with composer..
```bash
$ composer require choccybiccy/humanapi
```
## Usage
The library has been designed to require minimum effort for developers.
